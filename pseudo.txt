Aim of the game:

Understand:

Create a skeleton html file with a link to the games js file.

Create a function that randomly returns paper scissors or rock, 
check the output of this in the console.

Create a function that takes the players input (which should come from a prompt),
and compares it to the computers input, 
the computers input will be == to the previous functions return value,
make sure this returns a statement declaring the winner.

Write a function that loops the previous function five times,
this should keep a track of the outcome for each round and add up the over all winner,
then return the statement of who has won the mount rounds out of five.

Plan:

function computerPlay () {
    options = {paper, scissors rock};
    return random(options)
}

function oneRound() {
    userPlay = prompt(please enter an option)
    computerPlay == computerPlay();
   if (userPlay == paper && computerPlay == rock || userPlay = scissors && computerPlay == paper || userPlay == rock && computerPlay == scissors) {
        return "User wins"
   } else {
        return "Bad luck, computer wins"
   }
}

function game() {
    for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
        let result = oneRound();
        let j = 0;
        let k = 0;
        if (result == "User wins") {
            j++
        } else {
            k++
        }
    }

    j > k? console.log(Yay you did it) : console.log(you suck);
}

Divide:

sub problem 1 = how do I make a random string return in js? - solved using math.random to allocate random index.

sub problem 2 = best way to compare user input with computer selection?
